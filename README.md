# Welcome!

This git-hub repository contains commented code files as well as the datasets and their transformations used to create two AI models: Heart Disease Diagnosis AI, and the Medical Imaging Interpreter AI. 

The explanation of the mathematical basis and motivations for their construction as well as discussion and presentation of results is present in my research paper Machine Learning Approaches for Precision Medicine.
